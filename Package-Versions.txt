This is what the versioning scheme is supposed to look like:

Milestones:

mXX

TRIBrelease-name.0.XX.0
TRIBzap.0.0.XX.0
TRIBzap-upgrade.0.XX.0.A [was TRIBzap-upgrade.0.XX.A]

mXX update N (N>0)

TRIBrelease-name.0.XX.N
TRIBzap.0.0.XX.N
TRIBzap-upgrade.0.XX.N.A

So, from a package versioning point of view, mXX has an implicit
update 0 in it.

Releases:

R.X

TRIBrelease-name.R.X.0
TRIBzap.R.X.0
TRIBzap-upgrade.R.X.0.A

R.X update N (N>0)

TRIBrelease-name.R.X.N
TRIBzap.R.X.N
TRIBzap-upgrade.R.XX.N.A

The basic difference is that TRIBzap used to hae two zeros at the
front (for reasons unknown).
